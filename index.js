  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  One of the first things to ask is where is 'this' function invoked.  You have to look at
  when it was invoked because you won't understand what 'this' keyword is until it's invoked.

  1. Implicit Binding - the most common rule; when a function is invoked, look left of the dot,

  2. Explicit Binding - uses .call or .apply methods.  You can force a function call to use a
      particular object for 'this' binding, without putting a property function reference on
      the object.  So, we EXPLICITLY say to a function what object it should use of 'this'.

  3. new Binding - is a type of Explicit Binding and is used when you need to make similar objects, 
      but not the same (it's an object creator).  Also, the Constructor function (always upper case) 
      'this' refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the 
      constructor function.  When we call the function we have to use the 'new' keyword.
      For example:  when the code new Foo(...) is executed, the following things happen:
      a. An empty object is created and referenced by 'this' varibale, inheriting the prototype of
        the function.
      b. Properties and methods are added to the object referenenced by 'this'.
      c. The newly created object referenced by 'this' is returned at the end IMPLICITLY (if no 
        other object is returned explicitly).

  4. window Binding - also known as Global Object Binding.  Window binding occurs when, in the
      global scope, the value of "this" will be the window/console object.  DO NOT console.log(this) at the 
      global scope.  It will just return the window so, AVOID IT!

  Priority from highest to lowest:
  new Binding, Explicit Binding, Implicit Binding, window/Global Binding (aka Default)
